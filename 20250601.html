			<p>Architects in the early modern movement sought an ideological and design revolution, applying modern materials and construction techniques to create ambitious, functional and visually striking designs. They had, however, few architectural precedents to illustrate their theories in practice. An unlikely structure which had just undergone such a transformation – the grain elevator – provided a perfect case study. The study of this moment in design history provides a satisfying meander through the same factors which propelled the modern movement in general; urbanisation, globalisation, new materials and new techniques. The question I hope to answer is perhaps the obvious: why the grain elevator, of all structures?</p>
			<p>At the turn of the century a new form started to appear in the American Midwest – modern grain elevators, huge structures with the simple task of receiving, storing and dispensing grain in bulk. </p>
			<p>Agricultural production and consumption in the USA and across the world in the 19th century was primarily on a local or regional basis, with limited international trade. By the turn of the century population growth and urbanisation had increased the need for regional trade in grain, to feed cities. At this time grains fulfilled a greater portion of the average person’s diet than today, but grains were also feeds for livestock and horses. Before electric trams or internal widespread use of internal combustion engines in cars/buses, horses powered much of the transport in cities. I made a back-of-the-napkin estimate that horses could have consumed around 25% of grain production in 1900.</p>
			<p>The trends of population growth and urbanisation <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cjag.12372">therefore resulted in unprecedented consumption and hence production of grains</a>, leading to a need for new transport and storage solutions. This was felt particularly sharply in the American (and Canadian) cornbelt states producing grain for major population areas like New York and the East coast ports for export.</p>

			<p>Farmers would take their grain to the nearest elevator (which were dispersed at regular intervals along railroads) and unload their grain to be weighed, graded and purchased. The stored grain would lifted in the elevator and deposited into passing steam train wagons in bulk (i.e., not unitised in bags).</p>
			<a href="./assets/20250601/20250601-2.jpeg"><img src="./assets/20250601/20250601-2.jpeg" alt="Wooden grain elevator in Manitoba, Canada"></a>

			<p>These early elevators were wooden and could be produced using local materials and existing carpentry and barn-raising skillsets, but grew increasingly specialised with time. The weighing, elevation, sorting and storage requirements all provided needs which engineers solved with complex mechanisms.</p>
			<p>A major issue with the design was susceptibility to fire. These wooden grain elevators were, by necessity, located along railroads and required steam trains to pull alongside and stop during loading. This posed a severe risk of heat and sparks igniting the elevators, both wooden and containing highly flammable grain and dusts. It was therefore common to protect the structure with a corrugated metal cladding. </p>
			<p>While this solution may have been somewhat adequate for the local elevators, at the major logistical hubs, a great number of trains would pass through and the environment was to a much greater extent industrialised. Inside the elevator, extensive and complex systems of conveyors, rollers, hoppers and chutes were all powered by steam engines (or, as time went on, electricity – more on that later) and the combination of an explosive atmosphere and many sources of friction and heat required a more comprehensive protection from combustion. Thus, in the major hubs, grain elevators needed to be far larger and made from non-combustible materials. </p>
			<p>One such hub for grain storage and transportation was Buffalo, NY, and it was here that the largest Grain Elevators were built. Buffalo was in close proximity to a number of major cities in both the USA and Canada and crucially had access to the Eerie canal to enable lower cost transport to the East Coast ports, as well as canal and rail links to the Midwest. Buffalo also had a supply of Hydro-electricity from Niagara falls; in 1895 <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adams_Power_Plant_Transformer_House">a 37MW capacity Hydro plant was completed</a>, with generators designed by Nicola Tesla. This may have helped Buffalo grain elevators adopt electricity ahead of the curve; the colossal <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Northern_Elevator">“Great Northern” elevator</a>, a steel frame structure with brick curtain wall, was complete in 1897 and used electricity from the start.</p>

			<p>But the "brick box" design was not the solution that would come to dominate for the next century.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><b>Searching for a better solution</b></p>
			<p>1899, Minneapolis. Frank H. Peavy the “elevator king” owns elevators across Iowa and Minnesota and is seeking a solution, probably motivated by insurance costs as <a href="https://buffaloah.com/h/elev/hist/3/index.html#Great">this quote from the Northwestern Miller periodical indicates in 1902:</a></p>
			<div class="breakout">
				<p>a fire-proof plant of 1,500,000 bushels capacity would cost $195,000, against $150,000 for the wooden, but would save $13,875 per year on insurance. This is a very good saving, and would pay the difference in the cost of construction in less than four years.</p>
				<p><i>Northwestern Miller Periodical, 1902</i></p>
			</div>
			<p>Peavy instructs Charles F. Haglin, a civil engineer and contractor, who travels to Europe for inspiration but returns with the news that no more advanced solution exists there. Before we return to Minneapolis, allow me this tangent to explore what Haglin would have encountered had he visited Glasgow at the time.</p>
			<p><b>Grain storage in Europe</b></p>
			<p>Speaking to a well-informed Synaptec colleague, I learned that there was a dense industry of grain stores and mills centred around the Clyde, west of the city centre. Typically, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_R._Hume">John R Hume</a> photographed a number such sites in the 1960s, including ones demolished to make space for the Kingston bridge over the Clyde.</p>
			<p>I found records of 10 such buildings and can easily conclude that Haglin, visiting in 1889, would have found no examples of ‘modern’ engineering. For reference:

			<p>If Glasgow is in any way typical of Europe at the time, the grain stores and buildings were typical of much Glaswegian building at the time, being designed in Sandstone or brick and perhaps with elements of steel for internal structure. They may have used cast iron internal details to mitigate risk of fire, as can be seen in window-sills at the textile mill in New Lanark. The store pictured above at Cheapside street contains an interesting Modern Architecture connection to Charles Rennie Mackintosh, as it's noted that he had annotated the original drawings submitted in 1892.</p>
			<p>This can be contrasted with later Scottish grain stores at <a href="https://canmore.org.uk/site/183571/redding-grain-silo?display=image">Redding</a> (nearby to Grangemouth, so perhaps providing storage for import/export?) and <a href="https://canmore.org.uk/site/173366/glasgow-shearer-street-riverside-mills?display=image">Shearer street</a> which are clearly reinforced concrete structures, both sited in proximity to rivers and railways.
			<p><b>A concrete solution</b></p>
			<p>So, Haglin presumably returned to Minneapolis without having found an innovative grain storage solution. A 1976 United States National Register of Historic Places form records the solution Haglin arrived at:</p>

			<div class="breakout">
				<p>“The Peavy-Haglin Experimental Grain Elevator is a single, reinforced concrete cylinder (believed to be reinforced with brass rods)...The elevator, the first circular reinforced concrete grain elevator constructed in the United States and possibly in the world, is significant as an example of the creative ingenuity of the American building arts. It is the prototype for a type of structure that is now ubiquitous throughout the grain growing regions of North America.”</p>

			<p>The Peavy-Haglin elevator and those adopting the same solution established the basis for reinforced concrete storage of bulk grain. The principle of this solution would be refined and expanded to produce striking forms.</p>

			<p><b>Inspiration in Europe</b></p>
			<p>It's for that reason that in the 1920s European architects were inspired to the point of fascination by these structures, as well as other utilitarian examples of American architecture, despite their limited ability to view these structures in person. </p>
			<p>Perhaps the most dedicated grain elevator appreciator was Le Corbusier who included 9 images of American and Canadian grain elevators right at the start of his 1924 book <i>Vers Une Architecture</i>, which reached the UK in 1927 as <i>Towards a New Architecture</i>. </p>
			<p>Before exploring why, I’d like to point out that while the influence Le Corbusier’s writing had is undeniable it should be reflected on critically, bearing in mind both the limits of his writing (his arguments are often more supported by prose than a consistent chain of logic) and his Fascist apologism. While discussing problematic individuals and their ideas naturally brings prominence to them, it also offers a chance for critical reassessment.</p>
			<p>So, why were grain elevators such an important reference for Le Corbusier and peers? I’d say there are two reasons; they <b>(1)</b> satisfy his aesthetic theories and; <b>(2)</b> illustrate his argument that architectural solutions must be arrived at by logic (rather than repeating existing solutions).</p>
			<p>For aesthetics, Le Corbusier’s favoured the use of bold, large in scale and clearly comprehensible geometric forms in architecture. He saw these as expressing honesty and morality, as well as exciting and satisfying the human eye because the whole form could be clearly comprehended. </p>
			<div class="breakout">
				<p>“if [the] masses are of a formal kind and have not been spoilt by unseemly variations, if the disposition of their grouping expresses a clean rhythm and not an incoherent agglomeration, if the relationship of mass to space is in just proportion, the eye transmits to the brain co-ordinated sensations and the mind derives from these satisfactions of a high order: this is architecture.”</p>
				<p><i>Le Corbusier, "Towards a New Architecture", 1924</i></p>
			</div>
			<p>Indeed, many major grain elevators adopted a design based on consecutive cylindrical silos, creating a massive, sublime and rhythmic form. Being located in typically flat areas further emphasised their scale and perhaps provided a symbol of engineering prowess. The austerity of their form would have appealed to Le Corbusier; he aggressively rejects ornamentation, decoration and the repetition of existing architectural styles. (Content warning: racism and classism).</p>

			<div class="breakout">
				<p>“Decoration is of a sensorial and elementary order, as is colour, and is suited to simple races, peasants and savages. Harmony and proportion incite the intellectual faculties and arrest the man of culture.”</p>
				<p><i>Le Corbusier, "Towards a New Architecture", 1924</i></p>
			</div>
			<p>He also argues that Architects who specify decoration “[make] other people-masons, carpenters and joiners-perform miracles of perseverance, care and skill”. These quotes strongly reminded me of both the arguments and wording of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Loos">Adolf Loos</a> (who openly states his white supremacism, along with a hatred of seemingly everything, in Ornament and Crime) who wrote in 1898:</p>
			<div class="breakout">
				<p>“Ideally, the building speculator would have the façade stuccoed smooth from top to bottom. It’s the least expensive way of doing things. And if he did so he would also be acting in the truest, the most correct, the most artistic way.”</p>
				<p><i>Adolf Loos, "Potemkin City", 1898</i></p>
			</div>
			<p>And in Ornament and Crime (1908):</p>
			<div class="breakout">
				<p>“ornament does not enhance my joy in life, nor does it that of any cultured person”</p>
				<p><i>Adolf Loos, Ornament and Crime, 1908</i></p>
			</div>
			<p>Then in 1910:</p>
			<div class="breakout">
				<p>“The tiniest details are drawn in on a scale of 1:100 and the bricklayer and stonemason have to chip out or build up the graphic nonsense by the sweat of their brow.”</p>
				<p><i>Adolf Loos, Writing for Neue Freie Presse, 1910 <a href="https://testing.thecharnelhouse.org/2014/03/17/someone-is-buried-here-adolf-loos-on-architecture-and-death/">(ref)</a></i></p>
			</div>
			<p>In terms of architectural design, Le Corbusier felt that in the <i>machine age</i> architects should adopt more of an engineering attitude where material selection and design are outcomes of a rational and logical decision-making process in response to a <i>well stated problem</i>. He states that:</p>
			<div class="breakout">
				<p>“We are living in a period of reconstruction and of adaptation to new social and economic conditions. [We] will only recover the grand line of tradition by a complete revision of the methods in vogue and by the fixing of a new basis in construction established in logic.” </p>
			</div>
			<p>Concrete and steel grain elevators were thus clear examples of a new technical requirement being born of evolving economic and social conditions. American engineers had applied logical problem solving to the problem and reached a novel architectural solution, uninfluenced by historic typologies. Thus the reader is encouraged to “listen to the counsels of the American engineers. But let us beware of American architects!”.</p>
