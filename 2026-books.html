			<p><b>Sounds Wild and Broken</b> - David George Haskell, 2022</p>
			<p>I picked up a copy at the recommendation of Tom Fisher / <a href="https://actionpyramid.com/">Action Pyramid</a> at the Glasgow Listen Gallery's '<a href="https://www.listengallery.co.uk/archive/events/listening-as-porosity">Listening as Porosity</a>' event. His exhibition was my first real introduction to hydrophones and how applying technology to augment our human senses can reveal the activity of life underwater.</p>
			<p><i>Sounds</i> opened my mind, or rather ears, to the huge sonic variety of nature and has given me a new enthusiasm for <i>listening</i> attentively not passively as an important way of interacting with the world. As with all things, our world's sonic landscape (soundscape) is rapidly changing in a very short timeframe compared with the evolutionary periods over which our hearing and aural communication developed. As <i>Sounds</i> charts that evolutionary history for humans and other animals, such as birds, frogs, small mammals and whales, there were numerous takeaways that made me pause and reflect on how I understand myself, humans and other species.<p>
			<p>Particularly enjoyable is coming to understand how the hearing and communicating organs in different animals have evolved to so carefully respond to their respective sonic habitats and needs. This knowledge lets us make deductions about the sensory realms for both ancient and contemporary species - did you ever wonder what a Dinosaur could hear? or how much we know about what they sounded like? That we are today becoming more sophisticated in our ability to listen and parse the sonic communication of diverse animals is exciting and, to Haskell, marks an opportunity to change our relationship with non-human animals. He poses numerous prompts relevant to our conservation efforts today: why do we relate so easily to animals we can hear? which make sounds we <i>like</i>? and if we cannot understand their sounds, why do we consider them to be unimportant or unintelligent? how will it change our attitudes to be able to, through new technologies, listen to and even understand such sounds?</p>
